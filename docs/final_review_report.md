# Final Technical Review

## Scope
This review confirms the three capstone features delivered in this cycle: Gemini-backed FRQ feedback, the student graphing sandbox, and the teacher analytics playbook.

## FRQ Feedback Workflow
- Consent gating is implemented with a reusable modal that stores one-time approval in localStorage and blocks AI calls until granted, satisfying the privacy requirement for opt-in use.【F:js/frq_feedback.js†L1-L90】
- Rubric, exemplar, and feedback rendering helpers draw from the embedded `frqConfig` metadata, ensuring students see the target criteria alongside AI output.【F:js/frq_feedback.js†L91-L200】【F:data/curriculum.js†L37852-L37919】
- The Railway proxy now reuses the official Gemini SDK, enforcing environment-based configuration and returning structured scoring payloads that match the requested schema.【F:railway-server/server.js†L4-L131】

## Graphing Sandbox
- The floating action button launches a dedicated sandbox modal so students can experiment without leaving the quiz flow.【F:index.html†L38-L200】
- Sandbox scripts parse numeric and categorical inputs, compute descriptive statistics (binning, quantiles), and emit Chart.js-compatible JSON for histogram, dot plot, box plot, bar, and scatter previews.【F:js/graph_builder.js†L1-L320】
- Styles lock modal layout, field affordances, and responsive grid behavior to keep the builder usable across screen sizes.【F:css/styles.css†L4705-L4819】

## Teacher Analytics Playbook
- The R Markdown guide now documents required exports up front and validates file availability, giving teachers a clear setup checklist.【F:docs/supabase_performance_playbook.Rmd†L15-L82】
- Curriculum parsing converts the embedded JavaScript dataset into a joinable answer key, enabling automatic correctness scoring for Supabase responses.【F:docs/supabase_performance_playbook.Rmd†L89-L133】
- Subsequent summaries and plots reuse the derived `is_correct` flag for student rollups and difficulty diagnostics.【F:docs/supabase_performance_playbook.Rmd†L156-L200】

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Gemini grading depends on a correctly scoped `GEMINI_API_KEY`; deployments should include monitoring for missing credentials to surface the clear server-side error path.【F:railway-server/server.js†L80-L131】
- The sandbox copies JSON for manual insertion; future automation could add a “Create Question” helper to streamline teacher authoring.
