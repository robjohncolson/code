A reader of the study concluded that more sleep causes employees to perform better. Why is such a conclusion not correct?",
    "answerKey": "D",
    "reasoning": "The study was observational; causation can only be determined from an experiment. In observational studies, we can identify associations and correlations between variables, but we cannot establish causal relationships because we do not control or manipulate the variables.

Carla's goal is to determine if political party affiliation causes people to be more vocal about political issues. However, a survey is an observational study where no treatments are imposed or randomly assigned.

This is an observational study because the city planner is simply recording and observing the natural behavior of traffic at the intersection without manipulating or controlling any variables.

They will use a method known as a hair snare. A hair snare is a length of barbed wire set up near a salt lick, where deer can lick minerals and nutrients from salt deposits. The wire snares hair from the neck of the deer. The hair is collected and sent for analysis.\n\nThe biologists will randomly place 90 salt licks throughout the region. The region consists of 3 areas: the town, the forest, and the lake, as shown in the following diagram.\n\n(a) Two methods have been proposed for choosing where to place the salt licks: a simple random sample or a stratified random sample, with area as strata. Give one reason why the stratified random sample might be the better method for choosing where to place the salt licks.\n\n(b) By using the hair snare method, deer are sampled with replacement.

Fifty blocks made from the same wood were randomly assigned to be painted with either the new paint or the old paint. The blocks were placed into a weather-controlled room that simulated extreme weather conditions such as ice, temperature, wind, and sleet. After one month in the room, the blocks were removed, and each block was rated on texture, shine, brightness of color, and chipping. The results showed that the blocks painted with the new paint generally had higher ratings than the blocks painted with the old paint.

A group of 80 people with a history of skin irritation volunteered for the study. Of the 80 people, 40 were randomly assigned the medicated lotion, and the remaining 40 were given a nonmedicated lotion. At the end of one month, the skin irritation had cleared for 36 people (90 percent) using the medicated lotion and 16 people (40 percent) using the nonmedicated lotion. Analysis of the results showed the difference was statistically significant. What can be concluded from the experiment?",
    "answerKey": "D",
    "reasoning": "Statistical significance means that the differences in results were too large to be attributed to chance alone. Because the treatments were randomly assigned, there is evidence to conclude that the medicated lotion was more effective than the nonmedicated lotion in clearing the skin irritation. The random assignment of treatments allows for causal inference about the effectiveness of the medicated lotion.",
