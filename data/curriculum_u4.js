The following table shows the probability distribution for his score on one particular hole, known as the Water Hole.\n\nLet the random variable \\(X\\) represent Miguel's score on the Water Hole. In golf, lower scores are better.\n\n(a) Suppose one of Miguel's scores from the Water Hole is selected at random. What is the probability that Miguel's score on the Water Hole is at most 5? Show your work.\n\n(b) Calculate and interpret the expected value of \\(X\\). Show your work.\n\nThe name of the Water Hole comes from the small lake that lies between the tee, where the ball is first hit, and the hole. Miguel has two approaches to hitting the ball from the tee, the short hit and the long hit. The short hit results in the ball landing before the lake. The values of \\(X\\) in the table are based on the short hit. The long hit, if successful, results in the ball traveling over the lake and landing on the other side.\n\nA potential issue with the long hit is that the ball might land in the water, which is not a good outcome. Miguel thinks that if the long hit is successful, his expected value improves to 4.2. However, if the long hit fails and the ball lands in the water, his expected value would be worse and increases to 5.4.\n\n(c) Suppose the probability of a successful long hit is 0.4. Which approach, the short hit or the long hit, is better in terms of improving the expected value of the score?
