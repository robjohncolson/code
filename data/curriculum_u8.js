The following two-way table summarizes the houses in the sample.\n\n(i) Use the information in the table to construct a graphical display of the data.\n\n(ii) Assume there is no association between size (large, not large) and price (expensive, not expensive). Use the given totals to complete the following table with the expected number of houses for each classification if there was no association.\n\nFor associations displayed in the scatterplot, the strength of linear association is measured by the correlation coefficient. For the scatterplot of houses, \\(r = 0.82\\).\n\nFor associations that are summarized in two-way tables, the strength of association is measured by the chi-square statistic. The formula for the chi-square statistic is \\(\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{observed} - \\text{expected})^2}{\\text{expected}}\\), where expected is the count assuming no association and observed is the count shown by the data. Greater values of \\(\\chi^2\\) indicate stronger association. For the table of counts in part (b), \\(\\chi^2 = 10\\).\n\n(c) Suppose the selling price for the most expensive house in the sample is decreased from $489,000 to $325,000.\n\n(i) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \\(r\\)? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(ii) What effect would the decrease have on the value of \\(\\chi^2\\)? Explain your reasoning.\n\n(d) Based on your answer to part (c), explain one benefit and one drawback of using \\(\\chi^2\\) rather than \\(r\\) to measure the strength of an association.",
